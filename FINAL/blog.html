Everyone uses soft tops from world champions to the first time surfer! Back in the day soft tops use to be frowned upon because they weren’t made to surf the way you would want. They were always falling apart and never had the performance level you were hoping for. Now soft tops are so popular that pro surfers are coming out with their own soft top companies and they are selling out immediately.  Soft tops are especially good for learning how to surf but they have also come out with high performance soft tops that can surf like you would your regular surfboard.</p>
                <p>The soft deck top allows for a more comfortable paddle and is also very forgiving with dents and dings. They are lightweight, stable, and are more affordable than a normal fiberglass surfboard. Here we will go over the best soft tops in the surfing industry and why we like all of them for different reasons. We have took our surf school soft tops we have used for years and compared them to the best in the industry. Also we have talked to many top pros/amateurs to see what they preferred and also we ourselves have tried out every high performance soft top in the surfing industry.</p>
                <p>We all want to have fun right? When learning how to surf you want to have a surfboard with a lot of foam. This will help you paddle easier and will let you catch a ton of waves compared to a smaller soft top surfboard. We recommend an 8ft-9ft soft top surfboard with as much width and thickness as possible! Here is our favorite learning soft top surfboard in the surfing industry. The 9ft Stormblade SSR soft top surfboard is perfect for learning how to surf on any type of waves. With the added foam it is very buoyant and easy to learn on. You will be standing up in no time.

                    Surf Lesson - 
                    A common mistake among beginners is opting for too small of a board too quickly. When learning, you’ll likely experience the most luck on a longer, wider board. The reason it is easier to learn on a bigger board is that it has more buoyancy. The more buoyancy you have the more stable it is to be able to get up on your feet. As you become more confident in your surfing, you can try transitioning to a shorter board that still has some width and thickness to it (ex. a fish). With modern surfboard technology, you should be able to find a nice, stable board with no need to sacrifice performance. They make surfboards that are short but have as much volume (buoyancy)  as a long board has which will be your transition board.</p>
                    <p>  Find your sweet spot -
                        Every surfboard has a sweet spot, or the point on the board where there is an equal amount of weight and volume on all sides of the board. We also call this the balance point on our board. The first things Corky Carroll’s Surf School does in their surf lessons is help the student find the sweet spot. </p>
                    <p>Know the differences between paddling techniques - 
                        When trying to reinvent your surfing you will need to learn paddling techniques. When paddling out into the lineup there are a couple things to keep in mind. Before heading out, look for channels to paddle through (finding one can save you lots of energy). You’ll also want to time your paddle—it’s much easier to paddle out between sets than in the middle of one. If there is shorebreak, you should not start paddling until you are past it. It will be easier to walk to the opposite side of the shorebreak before you start paddling. Lastly, paddle hard. When a wave breaks in front of you, you want to have some momentum going forward so its easier to get over.</p>

                            Although here are many surf schools that are offering various surfing lesson packages that include surf lessons for kids, not all surf schools are equal. These lessons start with the very basic skills that give a potential surfer the confidence to balance on the surfboard and learn vital ocean safety skills.
                            </p>
                        <p>   There are a couple of surf schools where you can learn how to surf. An example is Huntington Beach. The surf lessons Huntington Beach are versatile and you can get private lessons as well as group lessons. The surf lessons are
                            suitable for starters, intermediate and even those in the advanced levels.</p>
                        <p>The essence of surfing schools is the all round way in which they prepare the surfers. There are essentials about the
                            dangers of the ocean and how best to keep safe as well as how to choose the best surfing spots so as not to put yourself at risk. The lessons will take you through the nitty-gritty of how to select the best board to suit the level at
                            which you are as well as your physique. Starters basically are taught on selecting boards that are easier to paddle, ride and stand on. The best thing about going to actual surfing lessons is that you will get to know about things like surfing
etiquette. 

By the end of your course you will be in reading the ocean environment for rips and changes in water
color and weather patterns so as to avoid the risk of injury.</p></div>
